In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Random Forests <br>\n",
    "2. Logistic Regression <br>\n",
    "3. Naive Bayes<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**General Applications:**<br>\n",
    "Decision forests can be applied to classification and regression problems. It can also be used to find the most important features in a supervised learning problem to be used in other algorithms. It has been successfully applied in face detection, detecting body movements in the Kinect game, internet traffic interception, video classification, voice classification, click stream analysis.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression is for classification problems. It has been used in the medical field. For example, it was used for the Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS) (predicts mortality in injured patients), diabetes and heart disease prediction. It has also been used to predict which party a person will vote for, the probability of system failures in engineering, marketing applications predicting whether a purchase will be made, and prediction of defaults on mortgages. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes classifiers have been used in natural language processing, spam detection, gender classification, document classification, detection of terrain conditions using sensor data in autonomous driving.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths and Weaknesses:**<br>\n",
    "Random Forests: Applicable to both classification and regression. Its strengths are that they are easy to understand, accurate, and give meaningful results regarding which features are most important. Weaknesses include decision trees' tendency to overfit, though using an ensemble model like random forests reduces this, sensitivity to small changes in data, and that it doesn't have straightforward probabilitstic interpretation. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression: Strengths include that it is robust to noise, can avoid overfitting with regularization, efficient, can be interpreted as a probability. Weaknesses include that it requires data to be linearly separable (unless we do some feature engineering by, say, squaring some of the features), has difficulty with binary features, it still may overfit even with regularization. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes: Strengths: less likely to overfit (important for a small data set), requires less training data if features are conditionally independent. Weaknesses include that it assumes features are conditionally independent. It doesn't tell you which features are most important. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relevance to Our Data:**<br>\n",
    "Random Forests: Our data, after processing, has a lot of binary features, which is a natural fit for random forests. It also can tell us which features are the most important, something that I would want to know if I were on the school board. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression: Prediction is very fast for logistic regression. It will struggle with the binary features, but our data also has a lot of quantitative features as well. It is a very efficient algorithm, which will help with our costs, and we can control overfitting by tuning the regularization parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes: Our data set is small, and naive Bayes is effective with smaller data sets. It is also a high bias/low variance classifier, again good for small data sets as it avoids overfitting. \n",

We would like to be able to predict whether she'll graduate from high school. We need a <em>model</em>, that is, a mathematical way of relating student features to whether they will graduate: we input the features and get a prediction as output. We can form models by looking a past student data in which we know each student's features and whether or not she graduated. That is, we can <em>fit</em> a model to the data. Logistic regression is one of the several algorithms that can do this. <br>\n",
